    <!-- Power Management: Specifies whether to decouple the interactive state of the
         device from the display on/off state.
         When false, setInteractive(..., true) will be called before the display is turned on
         and setInteractive(..., false) will be called after the display is turned off.
         This mode provides best compatibility for devices that expect the interactive
         state to be tied to the display state.
         When true, setInteractive(...) will be called independently of whether the display
         is being turned on or off.  This mode enables the power manager to reduce
         clocks and disable the touch controller while the display is on.
         This resource should be set to "true" when a doze component has been specified
         to maximize power savings but not all devices support it.
         Refer to power.h for details.

    <!-- User activity timeout: Maximum screen dim duration as a percentage of screen off timeout.
    
         This resource is similar to config_maximumScreenDimDuration but the maximum
         screen dim duration is defined as a ratio of the overall screen off timeout
         instead of as an absolute value in milliseconds.  This is useful for reducing
         the dim duration when the screen off timeout is very short.
    
         When computing the screen dim duration, the power manager uses the lesser
         of the effective durations expressed by config_maximumScreenDimDuration and
         config_maximumScreenDimRatio.
    
         This value must be between 0% and 100%.  If the value is zero, the screen will not
         dim before the device goes to sleep.
